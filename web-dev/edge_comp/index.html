								<h1>The Problem of Driver Fatigue</h1>
							</header>
								
								<p>Driver fatigue is a significant safety issue both in the transportation industry and on roads worldwide. Research has shown that drowsy or fatigued driving can be as dangerous as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1 in 25 adult drivers report falling asleep while driving in the past month. In 2013, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported that driver fatigue was responsible for 72,000 crashes, 44,000 injuries, and 800 deaths.`</p>

						<p>To address this issue, researchers and developers are exploring the use of technology to detect and prevent driver fatigue. Our solution involves the development of an algorithm that can detect signs of fatigue or drowsiness in real-time and take appropriate actions to prevent accidents. By integrating this algorithm with vehicles, drivers can be alerted if any signs of fatigue are detected, and appropriate actions can be taken, such as applying the hard brake, slowing down the vehicle, or turning on the lights inside the vehicle.

								<h1>The Solution: <br> Edge Computing and Computer Vision Algorithms</h1>
							</header>
								
							<p>To combat driver fatigue, we are developing an algorithm that uses edge computing and computer vision algorithms to detect signs of fatigue or drowsiness. The algorithm can be hard-wired into a vehicle and will alert the driver if it detects signs of fatigue, such as yawning, drooping eyelids, or impaired cognitive ability.

						</div>
						<p>The algorithm will take appropriate action based on the severity of the situation. For instance, if the algorithm detects mild signs of fatigue, it may suggest that the driver take a break or switch with another driver. However, if the algorithm detects severe signs of fatigue, such as closed eyes or lack of response to alerts, it may take immediate action, such as applying hard brakes, slowing down the vehicle, or turning the lights on inside the vehicle.</p>

						<h2>The Benefits of Using Edge Computing and Computer Vision Algorithms:</h2>
						<p>The use of edge computing and computer vision algorithms in developing our fatigue detection algorithm offers several benefits. First, the algorithm can detect signs of fatigue in real-time, which is crucial in preventing accidents. Second, the algorithm can be hard-wired into a vehicle, making it more reliable and accurate than traditional fatigue detection methods such as wearables or smartphones. Third, the algorithm can take appropriate actions based on the severity of the situation, reducing the risk of accidents and injuries.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Reduced Latency: By processing data locally, edge computing reduces the time it takes for data to be processed and analyzed. This can be especially critical for applications that require real-time responses, such as autonomous vehicles or industrial automation.</li>
							<li>Improved Performance: Edge computing can significantly improve performance, as data is processed and analyzed locally. This can lead to better user experiences, faster processing times, and reduced costs.</li>
							<li>Lower Bandwidth Requirements: By reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted to the cloud, edge computing can significantly lower the bandwidth requirements. This can result in reduced costs and improved network performance.</li>
							<li>Enhanced Security: Edge computing can provide better privacy and security, as data can be processed locally and does not need to be transmitted to a remote location for processing. This reduces the risk of data breaches and cyber-attacks.</li>
